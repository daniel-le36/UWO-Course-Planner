# UWO Course Planner

Web application for helping Western University students find out exactly what courses they have the prerequisites for. This way, they can search for courses to take without needing to continually verify if they meet the prerequisites or have antirequisites.

## Getting Started

This project is built with React and Python Flask so you will need these to run the project. A Docker file will be available soon.

### Running

In the courseplanneruwo-server folder run the _app.py_ file to start the server

In the courseplanneruwo-react folder run these commands

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Built With

- React

## Coming Soon

Due to the inconsistent wording of Western's course list, it will take some time to have all data complete.

### Subjects with complete data:

- Computer Science
